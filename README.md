# automatedCookieClicker - classic version

This script uses selenium to automate playing the old version of Cookie Clicker. 
Every 5 seconds, it will try to buy upgrades (from the most expensive one to the cheapest). After 5 minutes, it will stop and program will print final cookies per second number. 
The window won't close itself, so you can export your save or just play by yourself.
